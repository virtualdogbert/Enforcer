== Version History
* 3.0.0
** No functional changes, just updating dependency versions, and releasing to maven central.
*** Updating to The Latest Grails version
*** Updating to a new version of Gradle
*** Adding github action for building
*** Adding nexus build code for releasing to Maven Central
* 2.0.1
** Removing extra import from InstalledEnforcerService template `import grails.transaction.Transactional`
* 2.0.0
** Upgraded plugin for use with Grails 3.3.x, because a change in Groovy broke, compatibility between @CompileStatic and the Enforcer
annotations.
** Added more annotations to give a workaround for dealing with @CompileStatic, and @Transactional.
** Moved most of the functionality of the Annotations to a common Trait.
** Made the annotations inject a reference to the Enforcer Service bean, at compile time, so that Spring will wire the reference.
** Replaced generating a call to get the enforcerService, by getting Holders and looking, up the bean, with a direct call to the service.
** Moved the service into the plugin, as a base implementation.
** Updated the install script to install a version of the Enforcer service, and wire it in the resources.groovy.
** Added a separate install script for generating more extensive tests, meant for debugging enforcer.
** Added a new test application: https://github.com/virtualdogbert/testEnforcer33[testEnforcer33]
** Updated documentation
* 1.3.4
** Fixing Issue with arguments list in deployed war
* 1.3.3
** Found a conflict with @Transactional changed the Enforcer ast transforms to use the compile phase CANONICALIZATION rather than SEMANTIC_ANALYSIS
* 1.2.2 and 1.3.2
** Enhanced IDE compatibility using GDSL, so that methods from the Enforcer service and it's traits are recognized in the Enforcer AST transform annotations.
*** This means that the service has to be installed to a know location com.security.enforcer.
*** All other installed files have been changed to match the package, but unlike the service can be moved without breaking IDE compatibility.
** Added @DelegatesTo(EnforcerService) to the closures of the EnforcerService for better IDE support, for if the service is used directly.
** This will probably be the last update for the Grails 2 version, unless a bug is found. Although I have no idea if anyone
is actually using the plugin. If you are are using the plugin for either version, hit me up @virtualdogbert, on Twitter or the Grails Slack Channel.
